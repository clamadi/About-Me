# My portfolio


## Description
This challenge was designed to allow the developer build their own professional porfolio using the HTML and CSS knowledge taught with the aim of developing it to a better version as the program progress.

This helped me understand the different properties of CSS and their uses. Understanding better the different ways to style a page and make them user-friendly while adherring to the acceptance criteria.

In the course of this challenge i learnt the use of different CSS properties / syntax such as in-line blocks, grids, flex etc. I have also learnt how to locate the different elements on the HTML page while styling using the parent-child method. At first being able to locate each element on the html page was challenging. I have carefully arranged the codes leaving comments where possible to make it understable and easy for it to be modified by anyone.
